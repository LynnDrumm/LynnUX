fake graphical "OS" in mIRCscript

I started this some years ago because I thought it would be a cool and kind of silly idea. I'm finally digging it back up and trying to work on it again.

So far it does very little, and I'm first of all digging through all the code and getting my bearings on it. There were very few comments to start with, but thankfully at least most things (variables, functions) are named somewhat sensibly.
